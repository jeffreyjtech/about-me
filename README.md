## About Me

This biographical website presents information about me, Jeffrey Jenkins. You can participate in a personal trivia game about me, a number guessing game, and a single-question multi-answer guessing game. Then you can read a few words I've written about myself, including my job experience, education, and my top 10 animes.

### Reflections and Comments

#### Lab 02

- Creating the first version of this taught me the usefulness of functions. I wanted to use functions to compose the guessing game prompts and answers, but given the requirements I considered that an "out of scope" goal. As a stop-gap, I used a code block that was easy to copy and easy to fill in with the appropriate information.

#### Lab 03

- `for` loops are a little tricky but I think I have the hang of them. That said, I'm looking forward to the future tools we'll be learning to perhaps `break` out of loops. Without being able to break out of a for loop, I had to keep track of the user's success or failure in order to jump over failure alerts.
- Overall, I'm happy with myself. I think I achieved *all of the stretch goals*, too.
