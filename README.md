## About Me

This biographical website presents information about me, Jeffrey Jenkins. You can participate in a personal trivia game about me, a number guessing game, and a single-question multi-answer guessing game. Then you can read a few words I've written about myself, including my job experience, education, and my top 10 animes.

### Reflections and Comments

#### Lab 02

- Creating the first version of this taught me the usefulness of functions. I wanted to use functions to compose the guessing game prompts and answers, but given the requirements I considered that an "out of scope" goal. As a stop-gap, I used a code block that was easy to copy and easy to fill in with the appropriate information.

#### Lab 03

- `for` loops are a little tricky but I think I have the hang of them. That said, I'm looking forward to the future tools we'll be learning to perhaps `break` out of loops. Without being able to break out of a for loop, I had to keep track of the user's success or failure in order to jump over failure alerts.
- Overall, I'm happy with myself. I think I achieved *all of the stretch goals*, too.

#### Lab 04

- Driver: Micha Davis
- Navigator: Jeffrey Jenkins
- I was not able to get the Google Chrome accessibility tool to evaluate my color choices. Since the color scheme is essentially white-on-black I have no concerns about a lack of contrast for readability.

#### Lab 05b

- My finishing touches on this project were improvements to dynamic widths of my primary HTML elements and fixing up issues found in the HTML validators linked above. I'm quite happy with it.
- In an attempt to reach the stretch goal, I used Designsiration.com to apply a muted color scheme to my page.
